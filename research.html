                    <h4>Innovative Seawater Electric Generator with Water Circulation to be an Alternative Energy in the First Perpetual Ship</h4><br>
                    <h5 class = 'lighter'>Chawit Kaewnuratchadasorn, Puttaranun Boonchit, Putuchon Vongvorakul, Panuphong Pootawang, Sarun Nounjeen</h5><br>
                    <p class = 'lighter'>Over 1.3 billion people in the world were living without electricity. 
                    Not only the insufficiency of electricity has been causing problems but the main source, fossil fuel, 
                    has also been one of the world’s most concerned issues. In this project, a novel alternative energy source utilizing 
                    seawater as a renewable resource to generate electricity was introduced. 
                    The efficiency of the generator was dramatically enhanced using iron nanoparticles on carbon as a catalyst. 
                    The catalysts were synthesized from scrap iron and lard via solution plasma process (SPP) 
                    using voltage of 1.5 kV under atmospheric condition for 50 min at different arc discharge frequencies from 15 to 30 kHz. 
                    The catalysts were then characterized to evaluate its suitability for the generator. 
                    The results suggested that sample synthesized at 15 kHz was the most efficient catalyst. 
                    When only 0.6% of the cathode area was covered by the catalyst, the generated power was increased up to 20.8%, 
                    compared to those without catalyst. Furthermore, a 5 parallel-cell generator using specific catalyst provided 
                    the maximum power of up to 151 mW, which was enough to drive a small ship prototype. 
                    It is foreseen that the utilization of our seawater electricity generator would be the first promising step. 
                    These ships would be able to sail as long as it is surrounded by seawater. In the future,
                    this idea can be applied in a seawater power plant generator to meet an increasing demand of electricity in the world.</p><br><br><br>

                        <h4>Effects of Storage Time and Temperature on Recovery Rate of Dehydrated Bacillus subtilis Spores for Degradation of Oil Spill</h4><br>
                        <h5 class = 'lighter'>Chawit Kaewnuratchadasorn, Kornrapat Pongmala, Putuchon Vongvorakul, Arjaree Thirach</h5><br>
                        <p class = 'lighter'>Accidental oil spills have huge effects on marine life and ecosystems. 
                        Conventional methods of cleaning up oil spills (including oil boom, sorbents, burning, and dispersants) 
                        can further damage the environment. Natural biodegradation by biosurfactant-producing and hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, 
                        such as Bacillus subtilis, is one method which is considered to cause minimal harm. However, this natural process 
                        requires a long period of time. This study aimed to identify a quicker solution by investigating the 
                        effects of storage time and temperature on the recovery rate of dehydrated Bacillus subtilis spores. 
                        The dehydrated spores can be hastily reactivated in Luria-Bertani broth, then, exposed to the sites where emergency oil spills occur. 
                        In this study, Bacillus subtilis was cultured in 25%(v/v) vegetable oil in water and 25%(v/v) engine oil in water to observe 
                        biosurfactant production. The storage time of bacterial spores was varied from 0 to 15 days, with 3 day intervals, 
                        at room temperature to investigate their recovery rate by measuring optical density over time. Bacterial 
                        spores were also exposed to a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, for 1 hour or 2 hours, and later observed recovery rate. 
                        Lastly, the spores were reactivated in saline condition with the presence of nutrients to observe their survivability 
                        for practical usage in oceans. The experiments suggested that Bacillus subtilis spores could produce oil-emulsifying biosurfactant; 
                        tolerate over 15 days period of dehydration at room temperature, tolerate 1 hour at 100 degrees Celsius; recover from sporulation 
                        within 25 hours; and survive in saline conditions. Thus, this study proves the use of dehydrated Bacillus subtilis spores as a strong 
                        candidate for solving accidental oil spills while causing minimal harm to the environment.</p><br><br>

                    <h4>Plastic-eating Capability of Invertebrates Larvae: <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> and <i>Galleria mellonella</i></h4><br>
                    <h5 class = 'lighter'>Chawit Kaewnuratchadasorn, Putuchon Vogvorakul, Puchiss Panitpotjaman</h5><br>
                    <p class = 'lighter'>Plastic pollution has been a global issue due to the increased production rate and 
                    the cost of recycling process which is unaffordable for many communities. Thus, cheap and simple ways to 
                    eliminate these wastes such as combustion and landfill are more commonly used and result in environmental concerns. 
                    In this study, the biodegradation of plastics by two invertebrate larvae, mealworms (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>) and greater waxworms 
                    (<i>Galleria mellonella</i>) was investigated, with the purpose of comparing their plastic-eating capabilities, 
                    with respect to their versatility and consumption rates. Experiments were conducted over 12 days, testing 
                    the consumption ability of the larvae against 5 types of plastic: high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene 
                    (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The results show that the invertebrate 
                    larvae ate LDPE and PS more obviously than other plastics. Possible future applications of this knowledge include the development 
                    of a domestic composter containing worms for plastic degradation, and further study isolating the bacteria and enzymes 
                    responsible for the plastic decomposition.</p><br><br>
